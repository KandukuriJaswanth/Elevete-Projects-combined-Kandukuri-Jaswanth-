Elevate Projects Combined – Kandukuri Jaswanth
This repository brings together two comprehensive data science projects executed under the Elevate Labs program. Each project applies advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems using both structured and unstructured data sources.

📽️ Project 1: Movie Success Prediction and Sentiment Analysis
🔗 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/KandukuriJaswanth/Evelate-Labs-Projects1-FilmFortune-A-Predictive-Study-on-Movie-Revenue-and-Viewer-Sentiment

This project presents a data-driven approach to predicting movie revenue by leveraging both structured features (such as budget and IMDb score) and unstructured data (such as plot sentiment extracted through natural language processing). An interactive Excel dashboard was also developed to visualize the insights and support decision-making for production stakeholders.

✅ Conclusion:
This study highlights the potential of combining sentiment analysis with traditional regression modeling to forecast box office success. While limitations in data volume and scope impact predictive accuracy, the project effectively demonstrates:

The predictive strength of viewer sentiment,

The power of visual storytelling through dashboards,

The practical application of regression techniques in entertainment analytics.

📊 Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Industry
🔗 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/KandukuriJaswanth/Evelate-Labs-project-2-Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry

In this project, machine learning models were developed to predict customer churn in a telecom business using structured data. The solution incorporates interpretable models and SQL-based metrics to provide actionable insights for customer retention teams.

✅ Conclusion:
The churn prediction model successfully identifies at-risk customer segments and offers clear direction for implementing retention strategies. The use of interpretable features and SQL-driven insights ensures that the solution can be easily integrated into existing business processes, supporting improved customer lifetime value and reduced churn rates.
